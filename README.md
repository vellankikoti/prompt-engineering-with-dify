## **1. Setting the Stage: Installing Docker and Docker Compose**

### **What is Docker?**
Docker is a platform that helps you package applications and their dependencies into containers, ensuring they run reliably across different environments.

### **Install Docker and Docker Compose**
Follow these steps to install Docker:

#### **For Windows/macOS**:
1. Download and install Docker Desktop from the [Docker official website](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop).
2. Enable Docker Compose via Docker Desktop settings.

#### **For Linux**:
```bash
# Update your system
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y

# Install Docker
sudo apt install docker.io -y

# Install Docker Compose
sudo curl -L "https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/v2.2.3/docker-compose-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m)" -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
```

Verify installations:
```bash
docker --version
docker-compose --version
```

## **4. Hands-On Examples**

### **Example 1: Travel Planning (Bangalore to New York)**
1. **Define Workflow**:
   - Create a new workflow named `Travel Planner`.
   - Add a text input node: "I want to travel from Bangalore to New York."
   - Add an agent node to suggest flights, visas, and accommodations.
2. **Run Workflow**:
   - Test the workflow and observe the results on the dashboard.

### **Example 2: Weekend Food Recommendations**
1. **Define Workflow**:
   - Create a new workflow named `Food Recommendations`.
   - Add a text input node: "Suggest foods I can enjoy in Bangalore this weekend."
   - Add an agent node to retrieve local food suggestions.
2. **Run Workflow**:
   - Test the workflow and refine the prompt as needed.
