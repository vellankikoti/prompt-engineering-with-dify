## Features of Observability in Dify

1. **Prompt Metrics**:
   - Tracks success rates and error rates.
   - Displays average response time.

2. **Logs and History**:
   - View a history of executed prompts.
   - Inspect responses for debugging.

3. **Prompt Variations**:
   - Compare performance across different prompt formats.

## How to Use Observability Tools

1. **Access Logs**  
   Navigate to the "Logs" section in the Dify dashboard to view historical data.

2. **Analyze Metrics**  
   Use the metrics panel to review success rates and average response times for your prompts.

3. **Debugging**  
   - Select a prompt from the logs.
   - Review the response and analyze any errors.
   - Adjust the prompt and re-run it to validate improvements.

4. **Optimize Prompt Efficiency**  
   - Experiment with shorter or more specific prompts.
   - Use different models to compare results.

## Files

1. `logs_analyzer.py`:
   - Groups and analyzes prompts based on categories.
   - Outputs response time, success rate, and model used.

2. `response_optimizer.py`:
   - Suggests improvements for failed prompts.
   - Focuses on prompt clarity and parameter tuning.

## Usage

1. Export logs from Dify in JSON format and place them as `logs.json` in this directory.
2. Run:
   ```bash
   python3 logs_analyzer.py
   python3 response_optimizer.py
